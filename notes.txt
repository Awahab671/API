Recap class 1 -

What is cucumber framework?
it supports BDD where we use gherkin language

tags - Given When And Then Scenario Feature

Given - Precondition
When - Actions to be done
Then - Expected output
And - It is a supporting keyword that can be used with other keywords in a scenario


What is step definition
Step definition is the code implemented for the steps mentioned in feature file

page object model design pattern

Test runner
We use test runner to execute all features in multiple combinations


features = we define the path of our feature file here
glue = we define the path of our steps here
dry run = when it is set to true, it stops actual execution and scan all the steps
strict=true, it checks all the steps definition
monochrome = it removes all unreadable characters from the console output
tags = we can segragate scenarios based on tags and can execute them accordingly

Class 3 -

Recap -

Runner class - This is the configuration file in cucumber framework from we can execute our features.

@RunWith - junit
@CucumberOptions - features, glue, dryRun, monochrome, strict, tags,

hooks - @Before - we use this to define our pre conditions
        @After - we use this to define our post conditions

what is the difference in between hooks and background?
Background is feature file specific which will be limited to a feature
Hooks are applicable for all the scenarios available in features

Data driven test
